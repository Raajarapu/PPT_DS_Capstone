üöÄ How SpaceX Uses Data to Launch Rockets Successfully
This project explores how SpaceX leverages data to improve and analyze rocket launches. Using real launch data from the SpaceX API, the project includes interactive maps, success/failure analysis, and distance calculations to nearby infrastructure ‚Äî all of which reflect real-world factors that impact launch outcomes.

üîç What‚Äôs Inside:
Mapped Launch Sites: All SpaceX launch sites visualized on an interactive Folium map.

Launch Outcome Analysis: Success/failure of each launch visualized with color-coded markers.

Geospatial Distance Calculations: Compute distances from each launch site to the nearest airport, coastline, and infrastructure using the Haversine formula.

Data-Driven Insights: How location, proximity, and launch history may influence launch success.

üß† Learning Objectives:
Understand the real-world importance of location and environment in aerospace launches

Explore how to work with REST APIs and extract structured launch data

Apply geospatial and statistical techniques in Python

Build visual, map-based summaries for storytelling with data

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack:
Python, Pandas, Requests

Folium for map visualization

Haversine formula for distance calculations

SpaceX API (v4) as the primary data source
